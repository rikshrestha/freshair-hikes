# AGENTS
- Default to concise, factual replies. Summaries first, then detail.
- Keep files ASCII, avoid destructive git commands, and don’t revert user changes.
- Read `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` at session start; only load files listed for the active task.
- Testing: describe what to run; don’t assume network installs unless confirmed.
- UI: respect existing design language; be intentional, not generic.
