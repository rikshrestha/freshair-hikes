# Sprint 2 Status
**Current Goal:** Define and deliver Sprint 2 scope (to be set with the user).

## Task List
- [ ] Confirm Sprint 2 requirements and success criteria
- [ ] Break scope into tasks and update this list
- [ ] Identify carryover items from Sprint 1 (if any)
- [ ] Add tests/QA plan for new work
- [ ] Add CI (lint/format/type-check/test) and release flow
- [ ] Add crash/error telemetry with key flow instrumentation
- [ ] Add minimal analytics (privacy-conscious) for navigation/trails usage
- [ ] Improve accessibility and UX polish (spacing/labels/empty states)
- [ ] Strengthen config/secrets handling and per-env setup

## Key Decisions & Architecture
- Source of truth lives in `/docs`; start with `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`.
- Path-based navigation + history logging from Sprint 1 is the baseline.

## Handoff Context (Current Progress)
- **Last File Edited:** `docs/sprint_status.md`
- **State:** Sprint 2 tracker initialized; tasks now include prod-readiness items (CI/telemetry/accessibility/config).
- **Next Step:** Gather Sprint 2 goals with the user, finalize scope, and prioritize the task list.
