# Architecture (snapshot)
- Navigation: path-based (OSM-derived) routes with Mapbox fallback for directions; history logging persists to AsyncStorage.
- Data: trails enriched from OSM geojson; favorites, conditions, hikes stored locally.
- UI shells: Expo Router tabs + side drawer; React Native Maps for previews/navigation.

Update this section when schemas, APIs, or flow contracts change.
